C++ library with some basic machine learning models

## Contents

* **k_means_clustering**: k means clustering algorithm. The cluster initializations implemented are Forgy's (i.e. random) and kmeans++ algorithm while the trainig algorithms available are Lloyd's and Elkans's.
* **svm**: binary support vector classifier implemented with softmargin and optimized with SMO algorithm
* **neural_nets**: modular MLP model
